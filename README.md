# Data-cleaning-project---SQL


In this project, I focused on improving data quality through a comprehensive cleaning process. Here's an overview of the steps I took and the techniques I used:

üîç Data Cleaning Steps:

Remove Duplicates: Ensured unique data entries for accurate analysis.
Standardize Data: Applied consistent formats for easy manipulation and comparison.
Remove Null and Blank Values: Cleared out incomplete data to maintain dataset integrity.
Remove Unnecessary Rows and Columns: Focused on relevant data for efficiency.
üõ†Ô∏è SQL Techniques Utilized:

Subqueries and Joins for advanced data retrieval.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for better query organization.
Window Functions for complex calculations over partitions of data.
Update, Delete, and Modify operations for dynamic data handling.
String to Date conversions for accurate date manipulations.
This project not only enhanced my SQL skills but also deepened my understanding of data quality management.
